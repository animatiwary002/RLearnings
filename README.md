1. Problem Statement for Rplot_GalwayIreland.R

      Selecting an Irish county of your choice, find the names and co-ordinates (easting, northing) of
      towns in that county. You must have at least 20 towns. Using your knowledge of R, construct a
      visual where the town names (or abbreviations of those town names) are placed on a map as per
      their co-ordinates. Make this visual as professional as possible.
